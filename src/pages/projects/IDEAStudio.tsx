					<p>
						In 2018, Lake Macquaire City collaborated with University of
						Newcastle to design a new venue that to be developed in Speers Point
						Park as a significant cultural and arts space for Lake
						Macquaire--that place is now known by the name map MIMA. MAP mima
						was concepted by an architect student from University of Newcastle
						named Samantha Bailey and the building was launched in October 2021
						with collaborations with other artists to allow the place to be a
						beacon in Lake Macquaire area. And the intentions was to create a
						landmark that is opened day and night to help establish Lake
						Macquarie as one of the region's major cultural destinations, with
						the potential to attract national and international artists and
						exhibitions. Since it is initial launching, the area is used to
						create a lot attractions to the general public. This includes:
						<br /> <br />
						<ol>
							<li>1. Local Music Performance</li>
							<li>2. Art workshops for children</li>
							<li>3. Public and potential tourists attractions</li>
							<li>4. Food night market and social hangouts</li>
						</ol>

					<p>
						Our group initialize hypothesis, before conducting any sort of
						research, the users that comes and goes to mapMIMA as follow:

						</div>
					</p>

					<p>
						Our group then proceed to conduct research by observing onsite, data
						analytics, and survey to find out more of the area of mapMIMA and as
						it turns out the data shows us as follow:
						<br /> <br />
						<div className="mb-8">
